# Prime Solo Base Project

This base project is created to host the projects during classes
at Prime Digital Academy. We will be adding onto it throughout the program.
There will be 3 files that we will be working in this repo namely:

1. index.html - The index html file will contain a series of codes or tags that will be used to view contents of the project in the web browsers.

2. stylesheet.css - The stylesheet css file gives contains codes that gives styling to our content to make presentation more meaningful with colors, layout and fonts.

3. app.js - The app.js file will contain codes that will make the content of our project interactive and responsive to the users.
